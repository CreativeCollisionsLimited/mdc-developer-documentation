# Overview

Testing your code is like your best friend that keeps you from looking stupid in front of the people who pay you.

The goal of the testing is to have a stable application, with multiple assurances on multiple level of the code.\
For example, we have the application built from features, and the features built from functions.
If we have unit test on each function, integration tests on all features, and system test on the application, we can be sure
the application is working as intended.

<note type="tip">

An application is only good as the methods of testing it!\
-Keep that in mind at all times.

</note>

**A developer** mostly focus on the Unit, Integration and System tests, with in mind of negative tests.
But there are many different type of test and testing methodology, in many category.\
For example:

Functional Testing types include:

* [Unit Testing](/tests/types#unit-testing)
* [Integration Testing](/tests/types#integration-testing)
* [System Testing](/tests/types#system-testing)
* [Sanity Testing](/tests/types#sanity-testing)
* [Smoke Testing](/tests/types#smoke-testing)
* [Interface Testing](/tests/types#interface-testing)
* [Regression Testing](/tests/types#regression-testing)
* [Beta/Acceptance Testing](/tests/types#acceptance-testing)

Non-functional Testing types include:
* [Performance Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Load Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Stress Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Volume Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Security Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Compatibility Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Install Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Recovery Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Reliability Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Usability Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Compliance Testing](/tests/types#)
* [Localization Testing](/tests/types#)


### Testing applications:

CLI based:

[PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) - \[BackEnd\] Unit and integrations tests

[Codeception](https://codeception.com/) - \[FrontEnd\] Scenario and monkey testing

Browser Based:

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) - \[FrontEnd\] System and scenario testing
